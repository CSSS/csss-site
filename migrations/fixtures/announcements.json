If they pass, the SFSS will be able to secure loans for the project, and then begin construction in 2016. If they don't pass, the project in its current form will end. It has been three years since the project began, and construction was supposed to have started this summer. However, student opposition garnered enough support earlier this year to fail the loan votes at the spring Special General Meeting. The SFSS is asking the student body tomorrow one last time: do you want Build SFU?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"lead\">\r\nPlease see the websites of both the opposition and the project itself: <a href=\"notobuildsfu.ca\">No to Build SFU</a> and <a  href=\"buildsfu.csss.ca\">Build SFU</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"lead\">\r\nThe AGM is <b>tomorrow at 3pm</b> in the <b>West Gym</b> at Burnaby campus.

        "content": "Thanks to the effort of a recent alumni and with the help from FAS, the CSSS plans to host 20 people on a trip to Silicon Valley from June 27th - 30th!\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s still in the planning phase, so the costs and itinerary are still being locked down. But, we wanted to give everyone a heads up.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the trip is to meet with SFU alumni and their companies to learn about the area and what these companies are looking for in co-ops and future employees. You will also be attending a conference that weekend that will have lots of SFU alumni present.\r\n\r\nOn the topic of costs, the CSSS has been fundraising this year, and we\u2019re asking both the SFSS and the SFU Alumni Association for funding to subsidize travel, conference, and hotel costs. Once we have some firm numbers, we\u2019ll let you know what\u2019s left over.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll be responsible for obtaining visas and any other relevant travel documents. So look out for a formal announcement soon!\r\n\r\n\r\n-- </br>\r\nRegards,</br>\r\n</br>\r\nHenry Zhao</br>\r\nDirector of Communications</br>\r\nSimon Fraser University | CSSS</br>",

Highlights include a major company campus tour, the chance to chat with local entrepreneurs and alumni, a Canada Day celebration with local Canadians, and of course a lot of fun sightseeing. It will also be a time to learn about the culture and industry that drives so much of the innovation changing our world. \r\n\r\nThe trip starts on June 27th, landing in San Jose at 11AM, and leaving on June 30th at 8pm. \r\n\r\nThere's a lot more information, so please attend one of our two info nights: \r\n\r\n<b>Friday, May 12th</b></br>\r\nRoom: ASB 9700*</br>\r\nTime: 4:00pm-5:00pm</br>\r\n*This is a CSIL Lab, please meet outside the main entrance if you don't have access\r\n\r\n<b>Wednesday, May 17th</b></br>\r\nRoom: ASB 9705</br>\r\nTime: 5:00pm-6:00pm</br> \r\n\r\nWe will also have a table operating in the ASB over the next two weeks where you can stop by to ask questions, give us your name, and more. \r\n\r\nI'll be sending out a couple more reminders in the time to come, however if this opportunity sounds interesting to you and you want to be in the loop when registration opens, please let us know as soon as possible so we can make sure you know what you need to know. \r\n\r\nAs always, thank you so much everyone, and have a fun day, \r\n\r\nDavid Miiller \r\n\r\nCSSS President</br> \r\n<a href=\"dmiiller@sfu.ca\">dmiiller@sfu.ca</a> | <a href=\"csss-exec@sfu.ca\">csss-exec@sfu.ca</a> </br>\r\n<a href=\"sfucsss.org\">sfucsss.org</a>",

Ian boasts a wealth of knowledge, and is currently the head of IT Service Management at Paypal.\r\n\r\nThis information session will be an interactive experience, rather than the boring old lectures you\u2019re used to. Ian has recommended students to read the books \u201cOutliers\u201d and \u201cThe Tipping Point\u201d, both by Malcom Gladwell, to better prepare you for your future, as well as the information session. This info session will also serve as a preview of what to come for students coming to our CSSS Silicon Valley Trip. If you aren\u2019t able to make the trip, I highly suggest you to attend this info session instead!\r\n\r\nThe event details is as follows:<br/>\r\nRoom: TASC 9204<br/>\r\nTime: 10:00AM - 12:00PM<br/>\r\nDate: May 29th, 2017<br/>\r\n\r\nI hope to see all of you at the information session!\r\n\r\nRegards,<br/>\r\nHenry Zhao<br/>\r\nDirector of Communications | CSSS",

You can find the same information at the websurvey link provided above.  \r\n  \r\nAt Mobify, we're passionate about creating amazing mobile experiences and we're so excited to be able to share our passion with such talented students at SFU! We're confident that you'll come up with some butt kicking ideas and we can't wait to see them come to life. Obviously, mobile technology is what sparks our hunger at Mobify and our engineers have hinted at some impressive ideas that would knock their socks off. Up for the challenge? Here are a few ideas to spark your imagination:   \r\n  \r\n1) Develop an app for an event at SFU,   \r\n2) Develop an app for a particular club or organization at SFU,   \r\n3)Develop an app that will increase student productivity or efficiency at SFU,   \r\n4) Develop an SFU Social Networking App,   \r\n5) Develop an app for a small business on campus,  \r\n6) Host a Hackathon, Networking Event, or Workshop.   \r\n  \r\nThroughout your journey of completing your project, Mobify would like to support you as much as possible. With that being said, Mobifyers are quite busy bees! We've included in the submission form a few sections that request some more detailed information. The more in-depth information you are able to provide, the more we can help you moving forward. Think of it like Batman and Robin - partners in crime. If you have any further questions about either a type of project you and your team have in mind or just questions about filling out the application all together, please contact Christopher Duffin at cduffin@sfu.ca We look forward to seeing what you and your team's imagination comes up with!  \r\n\r\n",

Students using Java are encouraged to consult the course professor instead. The workshop also welcomes anyone who would like to improve their skills, even those not taking the course, as well as those who would like to take graphics in the future but couldn\u2019t in the current semester.  \r\n  \r\nIt will be a loosely guided, open space to solve course work together and will be directed by a student who took the course previously. His philosophy is that graphics was not meant to be taken alone.  \r\n  \r\nThis week, Thursday the 28th, it is taking place in ASB 9705. Due to convocation, we are still searching for a room next week, however starting Thursday the 12th of October we will attempt to hold it regularly in ASB 9896 or TASC 9204  \r\n  \r\nDevelopment Equipment CheckOut - Monday, October 2nd, 11:30-1:30:  \r\nEver wanted to build something awesome, but don't have quite what you need? No worries; the CSSS has you covered. We'll be offering a quiet space in TASC 9204 for you to come and view equipment that is available for you to borrow from our Tech Library this semester. Items available to borrow include VR Equipment, smart devices, raspberry pis, and more. Further, any equipment we don't have may be something we are able to purchase for you to borrow, and we'll be taking those requests at that time as well.  \r\n  \r\nWe also have many project ideas that would offer a chance for you to get some experience and to help the society, enhance our common room, and build cool things. Please feel free to come talk to us then for more info about that.  \r\n  \r\nAnyone unable to make this time can send us requests asking for more information about available opportunities.  \r\n  \r\n--  \r\n  \r\nThanks for your time, and have a great day!  \r\n  \r\nDavid   \r\nCSSS President  ",
