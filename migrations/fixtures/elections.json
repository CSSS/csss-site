I\u2019ve definitely enjoyed being the main point of contact with the membership of the society, but even now sending out e-mails to 3612.0 students scares the hell out of me.</p><p>I\u2019m hoping to continue on to a new role in our society, one which I feel needs a fresh breath of air. The Vice-President is perhaps the most general of yearly positions, serving as a backup president. However, the VP is also supposed to co-ordinate the operation of the CSSS, often through volunteers. &nbsp;The VP must be the person that makes sure thing get done, not just talked about. If we want pizza Fridays back, we have to man the table. If we want to improve course sizes and schedules, we have to push the department. A VP should make sure these actions are carried out, delegating what they can and handling what cannot be delegated personally. This will allow us to continue to do what we love and to do so much more.</p><p>Furthmore, the most important issue our society currently faces is one of size, not scope. We have many awesome initiatives, but dwindling attendance. I want this to be our grand focus this year, whether that is through better advertisement, more in person outreach, or more events. I want this to be the year where Hack-Time soars, Frosh is huge, and spirits are high.</p><p>To put it simply, the CSSS does some awesome things, and I want to help it do awesome things for even more people.</p><p>Thanks, peace, and have a fun day!<br>David Miiller</p>",

I would like to share with you some &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;insights of where I think the future of this organization could be going.<br><br>In my mind, computer science is frontier of human achievement. We are trained not only to excel in math and logic, but also to build things that takes us to a new age. We don't just aspire to creating a good life for ourselves, but also for the future. I am certain I am not only one that feels this way in the common room.<br><br>So what do we have to do? Well, good partitioning of value adding events is important. For example, hack time events could be partitioned in such a way that is more targeted towards students that want to learn particular skill sets. I specialize in iOS development in swift, but I am also interested computer vision and machine learning. How would I be able to teach iOS while learn Neural networks at same time? Surely there must be a way for me to learn from workshop like events; Surely there must be a way for us to work with the best programmers; Surely there must be a way for us to develop more than just what classrooms can teach us.<br><br>In my mind, hack time should be segmented into sections, each with its own targets goals. For example, a full stack web development section can quickly level up students in need for coop jobs. A prototype development section in can quickly train up students for kaggle competitions. An ACM competitive section can prepare students to handle technical interviews or algorithms for their projects.<br><br>I apologize if I come across too serious and grand deious, but I am older now and I feel the time has come for me to accomplish great things and contribute to the world. I feel that this is the best environment for both me and you to be in. I want to make more friends, and together we build something great for the future generations to come.<br><br></p>",

        "speech": "<p>Dear CSSS members,<br><br>My name is Courtenay Huffman. Many of you have had the chance to meet me over the past few years when I first started taking computing science courses and deciding that this is where my future is. One of the most important things I have learned while at SFU is that having a network of people is one of the best things a person can have. Recently I have gotten involved in WiCS (Women in Computing Science), and have had the opportunity to organize an event to visit Microsoft where the Gears of War videogame is produced. I have also gotten to know everyone who likes to hang out in the common room, where people are unexpectedly social. My goal will be to create an environment that will be most beneficial to all of you by organizing events that will create a social environment to foster stronger relations with your peers, allow you to have fun because everyone needs to destress a little after spending hours upon hours grueling over their code only to realize that they forgot a semicolon on line 48, as well as create opportunities to enhance your learning. I will do this in a few ways:<br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Continue hosting old-time favourite events<ul><li>I would obviously continue the tradition of board games night. Those are great!</li></ul></li><li>Host more social events that increase student engagement<ul><li>Host more movie nights</li><li>Host events that reach a wide range of interests to encourage participation from more students such as organizing sport or other physical activities, getting students together to play videogames, etc\u2026</li><li>Coordinately closely with &nbsp;WiCS to encourage more diversity in participation</li></ul></li><li>Foster an environment conductive to advancing our knowledge in computing science<ul><li>Set up a way to help you find external hackathons you\u2019re interested in, and help in putting together a group</li><li>Book rooms for group sessions to study (I think group study sessions before midterms would be super helpful for lots of you) or explore other topics relating to CS</li><li>Bring in more people from the industry to network or teach us about some part of the real world</li></ul></li></ul><p>This sounds like a lot to do, and I agree which is why I would create a more formal event committee that allows people to get involved in planning events they are interested in, to whichever degree of commitment they are capable of. You can be assured that all events will be the best they can possibly be!&nbsp;</p>",

Even though I only started in Fall 2016, I\u2019ve done a lot for the CSSS. I started my first semester as Exec at Large, doing odd jobs around the common room and generally making sure things ran smoothly. After the Fall, I spent my time helping the CSSS where I could while focusing on my courses. But now, I\u2019m back.<br><br>If I\u2019m elected to Director of Events, there are a number of things I plan to focus on. Firstly, I plan to revive the Events Committee. Once back, I\u2019m going to leverage the committee to help bring bigger and better events to the members of the CSSS. This starts with ensuring we have consistent board games nights, as well as working to come up with new ways to make them a little more interesting. On top of board games night, my plan is to have multiple unique events each semester. Events which engage CS students in ways we\u2019ve not had before. This includes working with David, our President, to ensure our new and improved Hacktime runs better than ever.<br><br>In case anyone may be wondering, here are a few of the events I plan to have sometime this year. Firstly, I want to make sure our yearly Hackathon is better than years past. Then I\u2019m planning on running at least one fundraiser on top of our regular hoodie sale. Additionally, as part of my initiative to rebuild the Events Committee, I\u2019m going to ensure the First Year Rep\u2019s do their part and run a kickass event for all the first-years. Finally, there\u2019s also the secret event I\u2019m working on right now, Project Sigma Foxtrot. Anyone want to hazard a guess?<br><br>Thank you for reading my rant of a speech,<br><br>Oscar</p>",

        "speech": "<p>For the past 4 years the CSSS has been a source of friendship and wisdom for me, and thanks to the efforts of past presidents we've flourished into a strong and successful community. It would be my honour to continue those efforts, and if elected here are some plans I have for the coming year.<br><br>Hack time failed: let's think about why and do something better. I want to reach out to you to get your take, but this is my tentative idea. I see two problems with hack time as it was implemented. First, it was unstructured, so the benefits were restricted to camaraderie, silence and hardware access. Second, it was at specific times and places without marketing. As a result, basically everybody who showed up was from the common room which means they probably don't have demand for camaraderie or silence. Since it's at specific times, they have very limited time with hardware. Finally, the lack of structure just bores a lot of people.<br><br>What I propose is to have a hardware checkout system so you can play with the hardware whenever you like, and structured technical workshops. Classes don't teach a lot of important skills for the software development roles most CS students are after:<br>- git, CI/CD<br>- VMs/containers<br>- Linux/server administration<br><br>The thing is that a lot of students may not even know they need to know these things. We've had git and Linux workshops in the past, so this is doable.<br>Speaking of jobs, we never have networking events! The earlier students can engage with the jobs available in the lower mainland, the better they'll be able to prepare themselves for the market. Nothing sucks more than looking for co-op and realizing you don't have what businesses are looking for. I have some industry connections, and I plan on making more, so I can hopefully organize tours of offices and socials at SFU.<br><br>Finally, I also want to explore ways of documenting the knowledge and advice that floats around the common room so that CS students can refer to it. The CSSS site is underutilized, and that's a shame.<br><br>Thanks for your consideration!</p>",

I've been very involved in the Computing Science Student Society, having recently served as Treasurer and Director of Resources, and I'm putting my name forward to be the Vice-President of the CSSS. I believe that I am a good candidate for this position because I have experience across many of the executive roles in the CSSS, and other leadership roles, such as chair for Frosh Week 2016 and this year's upcoming Frosh Week.</p><p>My immediate goals are to update and finalize our constitution, along with our policies documents. Our current constitution is out of date and requires a rewrite of several operational policies to reflect a more active CSSS. I would like to lead the organizational committee that would rewrite these documents. I will also work alongside the Silicon Valley 2018 organizational committee to ensure all the planning and grants for their trip are taken care of.</p><p>My long term goals are to promote more networking events and workshops for computing science students. The CSSS has a fairly large budget that would allow either student-lead or industry-lead presentations and workshops to be offered at a regular basis, which would allow students to learn more about the field they are getting into. I would also like to organize more events with the various Department Student Unions in Applied Sciences and other faculties, such as the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and the Faculty of Sciences. I would also like to organize events with the UBC CSSS, as many of our members are interested in getting to know students from another school.</p><p>I hope to work with you all and promise to put my best foot forward at all times.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Paul Allan</p>",

I have been at SFU since 2015, and have been involved with the CSSS since day one either as just another member, a frosh leader, or as the CSSS Elections Officer. As the title mentions, the roles of the Director of Communications revolves around handling communication between the members the CSSS, graduate students, and alumni along with performing public relations for the CSSS from promoting events to managing social media accounts in order to promote itself and expand its membership. Along with performing these tasks, I have several ideas I would like to implement as part of my platform to better serve the CSSS and its members:<br><br><strong>CSSS Website</strong><br>The first result on Google when you search for 'SFU CSSS' is our website, sfucsss.org. It's a good website with a lot of cool info, but it could be better. If elected, I want to revamp the CSSS website by updating or getting rid of dead pages, adding cool new information and guides, along with further integrating the website with the already existing CSSS social media platforms (facebook, Twitter, and Discord). This awesome student society deserves an awesome website.<br><br><strong>Contact Form&nbsp;</strong><br>As of now, I feel that it is too difficult for a CSSS member to contact an executive. If elected, I will implement a contact form, most likely on the CSSS website, in which members can contact executives with ease. With the contact form implemented, members can send questions, comments, and concerns to the appropriate person without any hassle.<br><br><strong>Discord</strong><br>Since its launch in 2016, the CSSS Discord server has become a staple within the CSSS community and has accumulated over 800 users! As of now, the Discord server is the go-to place to talk to fellow CSSS members about anything, and it is here to stay; however, I want to know what more you want out of it - which is where you come in. If elected, I will hold a meeting before the start of the next semester (most likely on Discord) to discuss the future of the server, and what changes you want made. I want the CSSS Discord server to serve the CSSS members in the best way possible, and I need your help in doing so.<br><br><strong>tl;dr&nbsp;</strong>- I want to serve you, the CSSS member. If you have any questions regarding my platform or just want to chat, give me a shout at pjalali@sfu.ca or in person at the CSSS common room.<br><br>Respectfully yours,<br><br>Paymon Jalali </p>",

I'm a 3rd year computing science student, I am also the current Treasurer for the CSSS. Ever since starting here at SFU I've been attending meetings and involving myself with the society because I saw something that I hadn't before. I saw a group of like minded students that made a difference to lives of their peers and fellow students, and I knew that I wanted to be part of that.<br><br>Before I get to why I think I would make a great VP I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Paul W. Allan for all that he has done for our society in both the little time he's been the VP as well as all times he's help positions in the past. And even now he continues to help with sage like advice from time to time. Once again thank you Paul.<br><br>Now moving on the part where I talk about my self. I think I would make a great vice president not only because I am prepared to sacrifice my personal time for the time commitments needed the job, but also because I think my past experiences have taught means to be a leader. I'm no stranger to taking on high maintenance jobs. In the past I've been the lead sound technician in a play, that entailed a lot of organizational tasks, communicating between the different departments (lighting, drama, administration, and the actors themselves), there was a lot of telling people to get their shit done. I've also been an editor for my high school yearbook twice, once with an official position the other not due to an injury. This job was mostly making sure the entire layout team was meeting deadlines and not slacking off. Essentially a lot of yelling at people, envision J Jonah Jameson from the Raimi era Spiderman movies, except Indian and without the cigar. Both these positions in the past have made me no stranger to make hard choices and staying calm when shit starts to hit the fan.<br><br>My immediate goals are to put together our FAS funding request package and to ensure that everything entailing that goes on without a hitch. I would also like update and finalize the changes to our outdated constitution, and to go along with this I want to put together our policies committee to update and/or remove some of our policies that are way out of date and no longer make sense.<br><br>My long-term goals involve working closely with the 2018 Silicon Valley trip organizers and leaders to not only learn about ways the trip next could be improved but also to start working on some documentation that would ensure the continuance of the great network trip for years to come. I big goal of mine is to see to that the CSSS grows over all, and the key to this in my eyes is attendance. The work done by the CSSS in my eyes is very important. We act as the go between for the students so we can relay information to the faculty about course problem and in turn the faculty tries to remedy some of these problems. The factually also at times tell us about upcoming changes to the program so that we can get the word out so no one is caught off guard. Beyond things at the academic level the society also tries to bring everyone together to create a community where people can access each other for help but also just meet new people and hangout. So, in order for these things to continue well into the future I want to increase the attendance in both our general meetings and social events. A major factor of this will be making it clearer to the students what it is the CSSS does and how they can get involved and start making a difference.<br><br>The CSSS has done a lot for me and I want to give back in the biggest way I can right now.<br><br>Thank you all for taking time to read this. And the best of luck to all the other candidates.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>VJ | Tb Orlbaq!<br><br>If elected I will be stepping down from my current position as the CSSS Treasurer but will continue doing the duties of the Treasurer until a new one has been elected.<br><br>I will also ensure that the new Treasurer is properly brought up to speed on how to conduct their job. </p>",

With the skill set that I have developed and a lighter schedule, I am able to dedicate myself to this position.<br><br>My vision for the future of our CSSS family is to tighten up the loose ends and bring us to a path of stability. One of the ways we can achieve this is by advertising our community to the incoming first-year students. Personally, I was initially unaware of CSSS until it was weeks later into my first semester. Our goal should be to directly focus heavily on reaching out to first-year students before the first day of class, through mailing lists, social media, event booths, and word of mouth.<br><br>In highschool I was the head of sales for the MSF club and I handle all of the finances and sale logistics for the club, where we raised an average of $1500 per year for charity. Also in grade twelve, I was the head of tech as well as the administrative representative for my high school's musical theater club, this role involved organizing logistics such as sending emails and co-operating with the administration since my school has strict policies.<br><br>Overall, I have the experience to take on this position that will help set me on the right path. Also, I have the time and motivation in order to help the society get to a better place. I look forward to help the society in anyway I can!<br><br>Thanks for reading and voting,<br>Ali Khamesy</p>",

Hacktime would be for helping people with a concept from the ground-up and not for getting help with particular assigment questions.<br><br>I would also like to put together seasonal social events for each month, such as:<br>-Muder Mystery \u2013 October<br>-Thanksgiving Dinner &amp; Movie - November<br>-Canyon Lights at Capilano Suspension Bridge Park &amp; Hot Chocolate Trip \u2013 December<br>-New Years Party \u2013 January<br>-Singles Awareness Day Icecream Party \u2013 February<br>-Saint Patrick\u2019s Party \u2013 March<br>-Easter Egg Hunt \u2013 April<br><br><br>It almost goes without saying at this point, but I would continue to host the bi-weekly boardgame night in TASC1.<br><br>*wording appears on the SFU Co-Curricular Record (CCR) Inclusion Criteria Checklist</p>",

While I do not currently hold a role, I am very involved in the society. Since I started attending SFU 2 years ago, I have attended nearly all general meetings. I am a member of several committees, such as the frosh, policy, and the constitution committee as well as others.</p><p>As Treasurer, I would be required to keep accurate financial records and tracking of income as well as expenses for the CSSS. I would be responsible to keep the society up-to date on the financial status of the society as well.</p><p>&nbsp;I plan to keep detailed records of society and to continue to attend each CSSS meeting. I am confident I will be able to keep track of the CSSS\u2019 finances to a high standard. I will also be helping finance all events run by the CSSS such as Frosh and Mountain Madness Hackathon. I think I would be good at handling this responsibility.</p><p>Thank you for your time,</p><p>Mitch Gale</p>",

I currently live at the Burnaby Campus, so I spend almost all my time here attending CS events &amp; meetings and focusing on studies (or wasting time in the CS common room).</p><p>Last semester, I was an Executive at Large. As an exec, I helped plan and run events, monitor club events in CS spaces, book rooms, and purchase resources needed for events. I helped at boardgames nights, regularly cleaned the common room with our Director of Resources, Truman, and was a leader during Frosh Week which included being awake 27 hours for Midnight Madness (which was so worth it).</p><p>I've discussed future events with Truman and our current Director of Events, Nikola, and hope that I'll get to continue working with them to run events over the next 2 semesters. We plan to continue bi-weekly boardgames (which might get some upgrades) and also have tentative plans for events this semester, including:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>An Applied Sciences Halloween pub crawl (hopefully with MSE, Engineering, and SoSy students as well as CS students)</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Fright Night at Playland with group&nbsp;</li><li>discounts and possibly group travel</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Scary movie night(s) on campus, with snacks!</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Pumpkin carving</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Christmas Hot Chocolate</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Christmas movie night(s) on campus</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Secret Santa</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Decorating the common room event</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dungeons &amp; Dragons (!!!)</li></ul><p>I'd love to have more 19+ events over the next couple semesters but also plenty of events for underage students too. I also want to ensure that events consistently meet any dietary restrictions or safety concerns, so that everyone feels included and safe.</p><p>I've had a great time getting so much more involved with the CSSS and meeting so many other students. I can't wait to get even more involved and give back to the society. &nbsp;Any and all event suggestions (or complaints) are appreciated and I hope to have a great semester full of great CSSS-sponsored events!</p>",

For those of you who know me, I look forward to representing you, and for those of you who are new, I only ask for your support and input. I understand that many students do not know or care about the SFSS. That's okay, and it is the choice of every student to involve themselves, but if you care about the following:\n\n\n\n* Tuition hikes\n\n* Student fees\n\n* U-Pass\n\n* Pass/Fail credit\n\n* Webcam policy and invigilation\n\n* Common rooms and student space\n\n* The Student Union Building (SUB)\n\n\n\nThen you should consider voting. I cannot promise you that you will get everything you want, but I offer something most SFU students do not have: an opportunity to be heard. We are one of SFU's largest and most active student unions, and it is unfair to be swept aside and kept away from discussions made on our behalf. My commitment to you remains the same as it has always been.\n\n\n\nThank you.",

Many of you who have been to the Burnaby Campus for classes may remember the CSSS Common Room in the Applied Science Building, with the current construction (<a href=\"http://www.sfu.ca/fas/asb-reno.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.sfu.ca/fas/asb-reno.html</a>) our common room will look different when we are able to go back. If you haven&apos;t been to the common room, in it you can find a microwave, pop machine, place to make tea or coffee, study spaces, as well as an area to socialize and make friends. With the renovations (currently) scheduled to be finished sometime in Fall 2021, I will work with the CS department and the Applied Science Department to get common room space and to make sure the space is nicely furnished. The space we get after the renovations are done will impact the computing science community at SFU for decades to come. I know the importance of getting common room space back and will work hard for us to get it.</div><div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif, serif, EmojiFont; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\"><br></div><div style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Calibri, Helvetica, sans-serif, serif, EmojiFont; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;\">As treasurer I ran our first Fall Hacks hackathon which was a 8 hour hackathon held in Fall 2020 as well as held our annual Mountain Madness 24 hour hackathon during this past reading break.

I&apos;m now running for CSSS Vice President.<br>If I get elected, beside chairing CSSS meetings, I&apos;m planning to promote more workshops and networking events for computing science students. While I was ADOE, I ran weekly events throughout my whole term. I was also one of the people involved in planning 2 networking/workshop events. One was the &quot;AMA event with SFU alumni from PayPal&quot; and the other one was the &quot;Coffee and Code with Distributed Computers&quot;. If I become elected as Vice President, I will run and promote more of these type of events. I would also like to improve the CSSS&apos;s relationship with other student unions by organizing more events with different student unions in Applied Sciences and other faculties.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you,<br>Shiva Sanei</p><p><br></p>",

With regards to the Discord server, my moderation team and I created &ldquo;The Atrium&rdquo;, a virtual common room that gave students a space to hangout and talk. We also created a number of channels based on your suggestions in #server-suggestions, such as #computer-hardware and #music-discussion. In addition, I worked in conjunction with Shiva, the previous Assistant Director of Events to plan and run the Coffee and Code event in our server which went quite well.</p><p><br></p><p>As can be seen, I have a good track record with listening to our members and acting on their suggestions. If I become elected as Director of Events, I will do the following:</p><p>- Host more Gaming Tournaments (CsGo, Valorant, Chess&hellip;)</p><p>- Host a larger variety of events instead of just the traditional board game nights</p><p>And as the pandemic restrictions relaxes, host:</p><p>- Pub Crawls</p><p>- Outdoor outings (e.g. Bonfire night, Camp night&hellip; Depending on students&rsquo; interests)</p><p>- Movie nights</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for taking the time to read my speech.</p><p>I believe that I will be able to do a good job as Director of Events and host events that members will enjoy.</p><p><br></p><p>Yours Sincerely,</p><p>Argus (Chun Kei) Li</p>",

My name is Dina Zeng and currently I serve as the first-year representative of the software systems student society and an exec at large for the computer science student society. Next year, I have been elected as the External Representative for the SSSS and I am running for WiCS co-president. As an executive for both student societies, I have organized and facilitated events. I have always placed an emphasis on helping students so, on top of events, helping fellow students as best as I can (answering questions, giving life/course advice etc) have been one of my top priorities. For the SSSS, I organized SFUYEET a first-year weekly bonding and board games night and other events such as SSSSpooktober and the FAS-wide collab event, Snow Day. For the CSSS, I organized a CSSS X SSSS X PSA collaboration trivia night. I enjoy working for the students and I hope to join the CSSS executive team for the coming year. I look forward to meeting all of you in the (hopefully) near future.</p>",

This is to say that I will (1) ensure the CSSS continues to maintain strong internal relations with other DSUs, clubs, graduate students, and alumni, (2) continues to maintain the same for external organizations, (3) Promote upcoming events (by our society, and events that align with the CSSS&rsquo;s interests) on our social media and through email, and finally (4) Help promote and maintain the CSSS discord server.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.28cm;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;background: transparent;\">Although my only experience with the CSSS is being one of the FYRs for the fall/spring term, I&rsquo;ve also had experience with roles similar to that of the DoC in the past such as being the (1) internal/external relations coordinator for the SFU STEM Fellowship club for the fall/spring term, (2) an ambassador (fancy word for someone who helps fundraise and promote an organization) for Millennium STEM BC (a youth non-profit that organizes the annual TechCon for high-school students) in high-school, and (3) as the logistics coordinator (managing sponsorships, registration, and event promotion) for the VSBSC (a youth non-profit in coordination with the Vancouver School Board that organizes a large annual sustainability conference for high-school students) in high-school.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.28cm;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;background: transparent;\">I am super excited to take the next step in having a larger impact within the CSSS and it would be quite &ldquo;poggers&rdquo; indeed to have the honor of being the next DoC.

I have been an executive of the society for the past 3 years as Director of Archives, and now plan on running for Director of Resources during our transition from remote to in person learning.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.28cm;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;background: transparent;\">As I have been an executive of the Society for the past 3 years I have been up to date with our current common room situation and I believe I will be able to help our society secure a new common room after ASB renovations are complete; Or an interim one for the time being.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.28cm;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;background: transparent;\">One of my first actions would be to kick start our merchandising as soon as possible once the pandemic is dealt with, members of the society have constantly been asking about sweaters and hoodies; So instant action is required. I will also investigate what options we have for the distribution of our merchandise via the internet, as our current system relies on people coming to the common room to collect their merchandise.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.28cm;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;background: transparent;\">Another goal of mine is to work on expanding merchandising of the society and conducting surveys to find out what students want to see from such a move. For example, I would expand the colour selection of our clothing to include pink, as I have heard many inquiries from students recently asking for such a selection.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.28cm;line-height: 108%;text-align: left;background: transparent;\">Cheers,<br>&nbsp;Dusan Kovacevic</p>",

If you&rsquo;ve participated in one of the many CSSS events this past year, then I&rsquo;ve definitely played a part in organizing that. As the Director of Events over the past year, I&rsquo;ve had the pleasure of hosting events for our students and gained a lot of insight into what goes into running the society. Between my work as DoE, as well as the organizer of CSSS Frosh Week 2020, I believe that it is apparent that I&rsquo;m willing to put in the work towards making the CSSS as great as it can be.</p><p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>As President, I will strive to do the following:</p><p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>&bull; Have the Executive Team be more accessible to student concerns regarding school and society matters.</p><p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>&bull; Develop the CSSS towards becoming a more welcoming and inclusive community for all Computer Science students.</p><p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>&bull; Build deeper connections with the other FAS DSU&rsquo;s.

If elected, I&rsquo;ll do my best for all of the students in the School of Computing Science. Use your vote to help me help you make the student experience as painless as possible.</p><p style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0cm;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;'>John Wu</p>",
