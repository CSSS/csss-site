## 1. Setup Python Environment
```shell
sudo apt-get install -y python3.7
sudo apt-get install python3-distutils --reinstall
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
python3.7 get-pip.py --user
python3.7 -m pip install virtualenv --user
python3.7 -m virtualenv envCSSS
. envCSSS/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/CSSS/csss-site.git
cd csss-site
python3.7 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## 2. Setting the Necessary Environment Variables  
> want to know why the weird way of quotes are used? -> https://stackoverflow.com/a/1250279/7734535  
```shell
echo 'BASE_DIR='"'"'<folder that contains csss-site repo>'"'"'' > CI/validate_and_deploy/2_deploy/site_envs
echo 'WEBSITE_SECRET_KEY='"'"'https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/'"'"'' >> CI/validate_and_deploy/2_deploy/site_envs
echo 'DEBUG='"'"'true'"'"'' >> CI/validate_and_deploy/2_deploy/site_envs
echo 'HOST_ADDRESS='"'"'<serverIP>'"'"'' >> CI/validate_and_deploy/2_deploy/site_envs
echo 'ENVIRONMENT='"'"'LOCALHOST'"'"'' >> CI/validate_and_deploy/2_deploy/site_envs
echo 'PORT='"'"'8000'"'"'' >> CI/validate_and_deploy/2_deploy/site_envs

# database configuration
if (you do not want to spin up a docker database){
    echo 'DB_TYPE='"'"'sqlite3'"'"'' >> CI/validate_and_deploy/2_deploy/site_envs
}else{
    echo 'DB_TYPE='"'"'postgres'"'"'' >> CI/validate_and_deploy/2_deploy/site_envs
    echo 'DB_PASSWORD='"'"'test_password'"'"'' >> CI/validate_and_deploy/2_deploy/site_envs
    echo 'DB_NAME='"'"'csss_website_db'"'"'' >> CI/validate_and_deploy/2_deploy/site_envs
    echo 'DB_PORT='"'"'5432'"'"'' >> CI/validate_and_deploy/2_deploy/site_envs
}

. CI/validate_and_deploy/2_deploy/set_env.sh site_envs

if (you choose to use a dockerized database){
    docker run --name ${DB_NAME} -p ${DB_PORT}:5432 -it -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD} postgres:alpine
    docker exec "${DB_NAME}" psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE \"${DB_NAME}\" OWNER postgres;" || true
}

```

## 3. Before opening a PR

## 3.1. Validating the code
```shell
cd /absolute/path/to/parent/folder/of/repo
./CI/validate_and_deploy/test_site.sh
```

### 3.2. Adding migrations
If you had to make a change to any of the `models.py`, you will also need to make a migration.
 1. First ensure that you are able to run `python3 manage.py makemigrations` without the need for **any** user inputs.
 2. commit your changes and push **BUT DO NOT** save the migrations you made [the new file you created under a `*/migrations/` folder]
 3. Verify that the staging website gets launched at `https://dev.sfucsss.org/PR-<pr_number>/`. it may take up to 5 minutes for the staging website to get launched
 4. If it does, then you can save your migration to the repo
