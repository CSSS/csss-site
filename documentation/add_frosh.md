# Add a Frosh Page for New Year

1. fix link on [`csss-site/src/events/templates/events/frosh/frosh_week.html`](../csss-site/src/events/templates/events/frosh/frosh_week.html) to point to new frosh page instead of under contruction page
2. Follow the example of the previous years and add the necessary URL patterns under [`csss-site/src/events/urls.py`](../csss-site/src/events/urls.py). You will need to add a url pattern for each new webpage you intend to make
3. Create a new views file for the frosh year under [`csss-site/src/events/views/frosh`](../csss-site/src/events/views/frosh). You can take a look at the views from previous years to see how to populate it.
4. You will also need to actually put the static files on the repo, they will need to go under a new folder in [`csss-site/src/events/static/events_static/frosh`](../csss-site/src/events/static/events_static/frosh)
5. The html page[s] that you intend to make will go under their appropriate folder name in [`csss-site/src/events/templates/events/frosh`](../csss-site/src/events/templates/events/frosh).
   2 thing to keep in mind about the html pages.
   1. In order to reference any static files [such as css, js, images, etc], you will need to reference them by use of the static tags `{% static %}`. Do a search through the previous year's html page for `{% static` for an example of how that is done. If you are using Pycharm for working on the site, you can actually see Pycharm autosuggesting what files/folders are available as you type in the path in the `static` tag
   2. You will need to place the tag `{% load staticfiles %}` at the top of any html file that will be using a static file
