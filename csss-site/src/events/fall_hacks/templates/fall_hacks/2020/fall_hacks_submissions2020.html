Because of this poeple who quickly wanna use the app end up giving bad reviews to a book which they have never even read. Users wanted a feature to keep list private and public as well. This app tries to solve that issue. Although it's not an production level app, it helps users to make public or private lists and add books to their data without having to give reviews and such. Since the app deals with books, we called it Library's easy access files to fit one of the acronym from the hackathon theme which is LEAF.</td>
