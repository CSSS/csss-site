	<h3><a name="CSSS"></a>Computing Science Student Society</h3>

			<h3>FroshWeek Founders</h3>
			<p>
			The six day long welcoming activities at Simon Fraser known as FroshWeek have been held annually by the CSSS 
			for the past six years. Without the continued support from both its executive board and members alike, an event 
			as big as this could not of been successful. Going into its seventh year, the society is responsible for planning, 
			organizing, hosting and promoting the event. Without the society’s support the FroshWeek tradition could not be 
			enjoyed by the generations to come.
			</p>

	<h3><a name="SFU"></a>Simon Fraser University</h3>
		
		<p>
			<img src="assets/images/sfu_logo.png" class="floatLeft"></img>
			<h3>Hosts</h3>
			<p>
			The University graciously provides facilities and space to be used for FroshWeek events. Without the continued 
			support from the University FroshWeek could not of become success it is today. Simon Fraser University has supported 
			and encouraged orientation events across its campuses and faculties.
			</p>

	<h3><a name="FAS"></a>Faculty of Applied Sciences</h3>
		
		<p>
			<img src="assets/images/fas_logo.png" class="floatLeft"></img>
			<h3>Gold Level School Sponsor</h3>
			<p>
			The Faculty of Applied Sciences at SFU has always encouraged networking and interdisciplinary events. FroshWeek is one of 
			our yearly opportunities to work together with the Engineering Science Student Society towards the same goals. The Faculty's 
			contributions have made Faculty wide events such as FroshWeek successful.
			</p>
		</p>
		
	<h3><a name="CS"></a>School of Computing Science</h3>
		
		<p>
			
			<img src="assets/images/cs_logo.png" class="floatLeft"></img>
			<h3>Gold Level School Sponsor</h3>
			<p>
			The School of CS have been huge supporters of the FroshWeek event. Their involvement in both the planning of the event, 
			as well as providing resources and funding have been beneficial to the CSSS. Without the School's support over the past 
			several years we would not of been able to create what is FroshWeek today.
			</p>
		</p>

	<h3><a name="SFSS"></a>Simon Fraser Student Society</h3>
		
		<p>
			<img src="assets/images/sfss_logo.png" class="floatLeft"></img>
			<h3>Gold Level School Sponsor</h3>
			<p>
			The SFSS has always advocated for increased cooperation and community among the student body. Knowing the value in the experiences 
			and relationships created in those first weeks at Simon Fraser, the SFSS has been a huge sponsor of FroshWeek. By aiding in both 
			the planning and organization of the week, as well as partially financing the event we are happy the FroshWeek tradition lives on 
			through their generous contributions over the years.

		<p>
			<img src="assets/images/simba_logo.png" class="floatLeft"></img>
			<h3>Gold Level Corporate Sponsor</h3>
			<p>
			Simba has been a FroshWeek sponsor for quite some time now, and we are thankful for their continued support for such 
			an important event for Undergraduate Computing Science students at SFU. With Simba's support we have been able to create 
			the tradition that is FroshWeek, which could not have been done otherwise. We are proud to have Simba Technologies as a 
			Gold Level sponsor once again this year.

	<h3><a name="imo"></a>imo</h3>
		
		<p>
			<img src="assets/images/imo_logo.png" class="floatLeft"></img>
			<h3>Bronze Level Corporate Sponsor</h3>
			<p>
			This is the first year imo have been a FroshWeek sponsor. Without the help of the industry we would not 
			be able to create such a meaningful and memorable event. We would like to thank them for their interest in the CSSS 
			and we are looking forward to working with them again in the future.
