    <p>University can be a daunting place to be, but not anymore! With
your very own survival training imparted to you by your fellow
computing scientists, university will fear YOU. But this will not be
an easy task; there will be races to test your co-operation with your
peers, tests of endurance to see how long you can last, strategizing
to out-play other teams, and mental games to keep your mind sharp for
those ever elusive exams we love so much.</p>

    <h3><a name="PacMacro"></a>PacMacro:</h3>
    <p>Location: SFU Vancouver, Harbour Centre</P>
    <p>Ah, the good old days playing PacMan on your Atari 2600... wish you could relive those days? Well, now you can! With SFU CSSS' famous PacMacro, not only can you relive it, you can be a part of it by being PacMacro or the three ghosts.</p>

    <h3><a name="TeamDinner"></a>Team Strategy Dinner:</h3>
    <P>Location: Downtown</p>
    <p>As you lick your wounds from the field of battle, know that it was but a small rehearsal in a larger campaign. As you sit amongst your brethren, fill your stomach with food so that it may prepare you for the events that lay ahead of you. Discuss strategy and seek wisdom from your leaders. Above all, prepare yourself for a long night of hunting, cheering and celebration as you match wits with yourself, your peers and most dastardly of all: the filthy engineers.</p>

    <p>Location: Starts at SFU Burnaby, ASB 9802. Goes downtown, returns to SFU Burnaby.</p>
    <p>There are so many strange things in our beautiful city, and now with our help we can show you even more and take pictures of it too!

    <h3><a name="Lunacy"></a>Late Night Lunacy:</h3>
    <p>Location: SFU Burnaby, TASC 9204.</p>

        help us to once again crush the Engineers in our Frosh Slurpee drink-off and
        dodgeball game. We'll then proceed to keep you up all night with an adrenaline
        filled race around campus containing copious quantities of games (both
        video and non), more random prize opportunities and other such
        mischief. Make sure to tell your parents not to wait up. You'll be...
        studying... This event goes all night so prepare to be at SFU till the
        early hours of the morning on Saturday. Prizes will be given out in
        the middle of the night for the points you earned during the week, so
        make sure to stay in order to guarantee yourself something nice.</p>
