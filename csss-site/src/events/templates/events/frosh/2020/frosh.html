                        <p>In the distant future of 2025, conflict has sparked among the students of the Simon Fraser University School of Computing Science. Disputes centered around the eternal debate of which programming language reigns supreme has split the student base into numerous factions, each vying for glory on behalf of their programming language of choice. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The fires of conflict burned furiously for 10 years, Only three factions were left standing to continue the fight. SupremaC, representing C, Javalon, representing Java, and Pytheon, representing Python. In order to end the conflict once and for all, the leaders of each faction have come to an agreement. One final battle would settle their war. This historic bout would not take place in the solemn halls of ASB, or on the vast data streams of CourSys, rather it'd take place before the start of it all, 15 years in the past. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>You, the students of CSSS Frosh 2020 have been invited to pick a side, and join the fight.</h3>

                                        <p>Their discipline and depth of wisdom when it comes to programming is their greatest asset.The faction takes pride in the fact that many of the world’s most influential programs are built upon C.</p>

                                        <p>The Low Level capabilities of the language allow for the members of the faction to write code that is second to none when it comes to performance.</p>

                                    <p>The Javalon Faction contains students that support Java in the battle for top language.</p>

                                    <p>Their name is derived from the tale of King Arthur. Much like Arthur's legendary order of knights, Javalon believes in the efficiency gained from managing their resources into organized structures and formations.</p>

                                    <p>This philosophy carries over into their programming, as they believe the object oriented coding style of Java to be the optimal way to write clean and efficient code.</p>

                                    <p>The students of Pytheon run Python as their programming language of choice.</p>

                                    <p>Those who fly the flag of Pytheon reject the complicated learning curve of other languages. The prioritization of simple, easy to learn programming has made supporting Python a very appealing choice to those with who would rather solve problems than learn syntax.</p>

                                    <p>Python’s ability to let its users produce code at higher speeds and ease than the competition is a great boon to Pytheon's influence.</p>

                            <p>The Simon Fraser University Computing Science Student Society (CSSS) is a student led society of over 2000 students. If you are declared as a Computer Science Major, Minor, or Honours, you are already part of the society. The CSSS aims to provide the best university life possible for all of the students in the School of Computing Science. Frosh Week is held every year in order to let new students get involved with the community, and help them get adjusted to university life. Throughout the entire year, the CSSS holds events ranging from Board Game Nights, to Hackathons, to Workshops. The <a href = "https://discord.gg/sfucsss">Official CSSS Discord Server</a> is an excellent place to get help with schoolwork, discuss classes, and meet new people. Whether you're just entering SFU, or have been around long enough to remember when the Student Union Building was first promised to us, the CSSS is glad to make your student life all the better.</p>

                                <h2>CSSS 100 - The Introduction to the Introduction to Computing Science</h2>
                                <p>Have you found yourself in the School of Computing Science despite having no programming experience whatsoever? Worried that you will be swiftly left behind by your professor and unable to catch up? Just feel like listening to someone ramble on for one and a half hours to get a feeling for the true lecture experience? We've got something for that! Join us at our Canvas Course at <a href = "https://canvas.sfu.ca/enroll/9GB9R4">https://canvas.sfu.ca/enroll/9GB9R4 </a>where we'll be going over the very basic fundamentals of programming. </p>
                                <p>
                                The Course Outline is as follows:</br>
                                Monday: Input, Output, Variables</br>
                                Tuesday: Functions, if statements</br>
                                Wednesday: Loops, Arrays</br>
                                Thursday: Program Showcase / Mini Project</br>
                                Friday: Project Showcase</br> </p>
                                <p>You'll get hands on experience as we walk you through coding various introductory programs and go over the logic behind them. This is an invaluable opportunity if you would like to get a head start on learning programming, want to get practice in a helpful environment, or just want to brush up on your skills.</p>
                                <h2>CS Info Session: Wednesday 3:00pm - 4:30pm</h2>
                                <p>The CS Info Session is a one and a half hour talk on our <a href = "https://canvas.sfu.ca/enroll/9GB9R4">Canvas Course</a> featuring many different prominent groups within the School of Computing Science. Featuring guest speakers from the Computing Science Student Society, CS Co-Op Office, Software Systems Student Society, Women In Computing Science, and CS Advising. Learn about all the opportunities open to you and what to look forward to in your four (or more!) years at SFU. Earn points for your faction by attending and sticking around until the end.</p>

                                <h2>The Gaming Arena</h2>
                                <p>Back in the day, before declaring digital war became the cool way to settle your conflicts with people who disagreed with you, there was online competitive video gaming. We'd love to have you all settle this like real programmers and start coding destructo-bots to duel each other on the ASB roof, but the administration wouldn't let us do that because of "accountability laws" or something lame like that. That means, we'll have to settle things the old fashioned way. Assemble a team in any video game you feel like, and earn points for your faction by defeating any team that stands between you and those sweet bragging rights.</p>
                                <h2>Art Contest</h2>
                                <p>Ok, so mayyybe you aren't so good at video games. You can stil be better than those other people in some way right? How about drawing pictures? Yeah, those suckers in [INSERT OTHER TWO FACTIONS] can't draw at all. If Bob Ross' ghost came by and possessed their computer then ... well uhhh, they're gonna have to call the Ghostbusters or something. Maybe move to a less haunted part of the neighbourhood. Point is, its time to prove that your faction is not only superior computationally, but also artistically. Earn points for your faction by entering a submission into the Art Contest. The top 3 entries win points for their team. The first place winner also wins a special surprize prize that will be rewarded at the Closing Ceremony.</p>
                                <h2>Closing Ceremony 4:00pm - 6:00pm</h2>
                                <p>As the dust settles after the week-long battle, only a single faction may rise above the rest and claim victory. Only one single faction will stand tall, and proclaim victory for their programming language. Will it be yours?
                                </p>
                                <p>All Frosh Week participants will be entered in a give away for Amazon Gift Cards.</p>
                                <p>The First Place Faction gets a giveaway for: <b>Three $10 Amazon Gift Cards</b></br>
                                The Second Place Faction gets a giveaway for: <b>Two $5 Amazon Gift Cards</b></br>
                                The Third Place Faction gets a giveaway for: <b>Two $5 Amazon Gift Cards</b></p>
                                <p>After this week, victorious or not, you can stand proud with your fellow Computer Science students. Reminisce about the experiences shared, how you’ll never forget them, and how you’ll definitely be back next year as a Frosh Leader.</p>
