Learn about all the opportunities open to you and what to look forward to in your four (or more!) years at SFU. Stick around until the end if you don't want to miss the free BBQ!

                <p><b>Dinner Downtown:</b> As you lick your wounds from the field of battle, know that it was but a small rehearsal in a larger campaign. As you sit amongst your brethren, fill your stomach with food so that it may prepare you for the events that lay ahead of you. Discuss strategy and seek wisdom from your leaders. Above all, prepare yourself for a long night of hunting, cheering and celebration as you will match wits with yourself, your peers and most dastardly of all: the filthy engineers.

And most importantly, re-caffeinate after that 8:30 math class! Feel free to drop in and leave as you please. Like most WiCS events, this tea is open to students of any gender.

But these aren’t just any old undead menaces, these are your fellow students in more costumes homemade by a CS student (again, really sorry!).

                <p><b>Midnight Madness:</b> You’ve heard whispers in the shadows and tales on the streets, but this is finally it. The time has arrived for the weak to fall by the wayside and for the strong to survive. It’s time to learn the joy of all-nighters with all the work and none of the fun. We do battle against the engineers at the Frosh Slurpee drink-off, dodgeball game, and more. Inbetween these grueling battles we'll help keep you up all night with adrenaline filled skirmishes containing copious quantities of games, random prize opportunities, and other such mischief.
                    <br>
                    <br>Make sure to tell your parents not to wait up. You probably don’t want them to know of the horrors that go on during the night so... Tell them you’re studying! Ya, they'll totally believe that! Now remember, Midnight Madness goes all night so prepare to be at SFU till the wee hours of the morning on Saturday. The culmination of the week long mystery which may or may not exist will be revealed during the night, so make sure you stay to find out the maybe-possibly-not-sure twist ending.

                <p><b>RAMing Ceremony:</b> You, the few, the proud, the chosen, the survivors, shall face a trial the likes of which you’ve never faced before. A trial culminating in your anointment with a token of fellowship as CS students. After partaking in this time-honoured tradition there will be no doubt in your mind that you are truly Computer Science students. Once the anointed hour has passed you’ll take your first steps as true members, seeing our sacred ground in a whole new light.

                <p><b>What's the difference between Frosh Week and <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/students/orientation/welcome-day.html">SFU Welcome Day</a>?</b>
                    <br>SFU Welcome Day is a very informative event held in August that teaches you where stuff on campus is, how to be successful, and prepares you for a solid start at university. You will meet one upper-year student, called your Orientation Leader (OL) who may or may not be in Computing Science, and ~15 other students in Applied Science. It's useful, especially for those who don't know the campus very well. Frosh Week is just pure, unadulterated FUN, and is for all CS students, regardless of how well you know the campus. You will meet dozens of wise upper-year students and other first years in CS. You will learn things the Orientation Leaders aren't allowed to tell you. You'll compete for awesome prizes, and receive tons of food. You'll make memories that you'll look back on 20 years down the road. Awesome! Frosh Week is the easiest way to meet people, and is completely different from the 2 days of information you'll receive during SFU Orientation.</p>
                <p><b>Will there be alcohol?</b>
                    <br>No! We will not be providing you with alcohol.</p>
                <p><b>Is Frosh Week worth it?</b>
                    <br>Definitely! This is going to be the best week of your undergraduate life. Also, it’s a great way to instantly make friends and know the ins and outs of campus and school life!</p>
                <p><b>Do I need to attend all the events in the schedule as I have classes that conflicts with them?</b>
                    <br>We know that we have lots going on during the first week and although it would be great to attend all of them we know it is not realistically possible. So we have marked the events that are essential to go to, i.e. Registration BBQ and Midnight Madness.. If you have any classes that conflicts with those events contact us using <a href="mailto:csss-froshchair@sfu.ca">csss@sfu.ca</a> as early as possible and we'll let you know what to do.</p>
                <p><b>What is the best way to get more information about Frosh Week?</b>
                    <br>The best way to get information is checking the website periodically since we add more content to it as we get closer to Frosh Week. However if you have a question that hasn't been answered, send our <a href="mailto:csss-froshchair@sfu.ca">team</a> an email and we will get back to you as soon as possible. If it is a general question we will post it on the website for everybody else as well.</p>
                <p><b>I am unable to make an event. Can events be missed, entered late, or left early?</b>
                    <br>Yes. We understand that students may not be able to make every event. Although, we would prefer it if all participants were able to make these events: Registration BBQ, RAMing Ceremony, PacMacro and Midnight Madness as they are essential to the Frosh Week experience. If you need to leave an event early, just let a Frosh leader know what's going on. If you need to join an event late, please find out before hand where we will be, as some of our events will move around to different areas.</p>

                <p><b>I am located at the Surrey campus, can I still attend Frosh Week?</b>
                    <br>Yes, Frosh Week is open to any and all Computing Science Students, but on-campus events are held at the SFU Burnaby Campus. Feel free to come join us for any of the events that you are able to make. Unfortunately some events will be during your classes at Surrey, other events are held later in the day or in downtown Vancouver. As Software Systems and Mechatronics usually have events at the Surrey campus also,links to their events as well as Engineering wil be available here soon. <!-- Additionally, <a href="">Software Systems</a> [<a href="">Facebook Event Accessible Here</a> ] and Mechatronics have their own <a href="">Frosh Week events</a> at the Surrey campus.</p>  -->
                <p><b>How much does Frosh Week cost?</b>
                    <br>It's free!</p>
                <p><b>Do I have to go to every event?</b>
                    <br>While we do recommend you go to every event, of course you don’t have to. But going to all the events gives you the full experience of Frosh Week, as well as SFU and the rest of campus. Plus, let’s be honest, free food AND free stuff is a combination you don’t want to miss. Especially when there’s the possibility that you meet someone awesome just 5 minutes later.</p>
                <p><b>I am a mature student or am already very familiar with campus and services offered. Do I still need to go?</b>
                    <br>Yes! Of course! Don't think of Frosh Week as an orientation, but a chance to meet a lot of the people you will be studying and working with for the next few years and party it up a little. The point of it all, aside from meeting people, is to have fun!</p>
                <p><b>What if I don't know anyone?</b>
                    <br>Don’t worry! Everyone is in the same boat! Start with a simple “Hey, my name is” and you should be fine. If you’re super concerned about not knowing anyone, we’re going to put you in small groups first so that you can be more comfortable.</p>
                <p><b>Where should I go on the first day?</b>
                    <br>The Atrium of the Applied Science Building. We’ll be there waiting!</p>
                <p><b>Where can I get a digital copy of the Survival Guide?</b>
                    <br><a href="{%  static 'events_static/frosh/2018/mainsite/2018 Frosh Survival Guide.pdf' %}">Right here! :)</a></p>

                    <h3>Frosh Kits</h3>
                    <p>Every year, the CSSS assembles Frosh Kits for new students made up of small toys, branded merchandise, and gadgets that are provided by companies like you. If you wish to contribute we just ask that you provide at least 100 items due to the large number of students who participate every year in Frosh Week. Past items have included:</p>

                    <ul class="emphasis">
                        <li>Buttons</li>
