    <h2><a id="Ceremony"></a>RAM'ing Invocation Ceremony:</h2>
    <p>Location: SFU Burnaby, IRMACS Theatre</p>

    <h2><a id="AmazingRace"></a>CS Amazing Race:</h2>
    <p>Location: SFU Burnaby, Starts at IRMACS Theatre. Goes around Burnaby campus.</p>

    <h2><a id="Training"></a>Survival Training:</h2>
    <p>Location: SFU Burnaby, Starts at the ASB Atrium. Takes place in the AQ Gardens.<p>
    <p>University can be a daunting place to be, but not anymore! With your very own survival training imparted to you by your fellow computing scientists, university will fear YOU. But this will not be an easy task; there will be races to test your co-operation with your peers, tests of endurance to see how long you can last, strategizing to out-play other teams, and mental games to keep your mind sharp for those ever elusive exams we love so much. Most importantly of all, you'll be ready to take on the engineers head to head on Friday night.</p>

    <h2><a id="LazerTag"></a>Lazer Tag:</h2>
    <p>Location: Planet Lazer, One block from Braid Skytrain Station</p>
    <p>Fight for glory as you battle it out with your peers to see who will reign champion.</p>

    <p>Location: SFU Vancouver, Harbour Centre. Meet in the ASB Atrium, we'll commute downtown together.</p>
    <p>Ah, the good old days playing PacMan on your Atari 2600... wish you could relive those days? Well, now you can! With SFU CSSS' famous PacMacro, not only can you relive it, you can be a part of it by being PacMacro or the four ghosts.</p>

    <h2><a id="TeamDinner"></a>Team Strategy Dinner:</h2>
    <P>Location: Downtown</p>
    <p>As you lick your wounds from the field of battle, know that it was but a small rehearsal in a larger campaign. As you sit amongst your brethren, fill your stomach with food so that it may prepare you for the events that lay ahead of you. Discuss strategy and seek wisdom from your leaders. Above all, prepare yourself for a long night of hunting, cheering and celebration as the next day you will match wits with yourself, your peers and most dastardly of all: the filthy engineers.</p>

    <h2><a id="PhotoHunt"></a>Photo Hunt:</h2>
    <p>Location: Starts at SFU Burnaby, ASB Atrium. Goes downtown, returns to SFU Burnaby.</p>
    <p>There are so many strange things in our beautiful city, and now with our help we can show you even more and take pictures of it too! Perhaps there will also be a secret mission for you froshees that may put you into the SFU history books. Want to know more? Well, you'll just have to wait, won't you.</p>

    <h2><a id="Lunacy"></a>Late Night Lunacy:</h2>
    <p>Location: SFU Burnaby, TASC 9204.</p>
    <p>Learn the joy of all-nighters with all of the fun and none of the work! First, help us to once again crush the Engineers in our Frosh Slurpee drink-off, dodgeball game, and tug-of-war. We'll then proceed to keep you up all night with an adrenaline filled race around campus containing copious quantities of games (both video and non), more random prize opportunities and other such mischief. Make sure to tell your parents not to wait up. You'll be... studying... This event goes all night so prepare to be at SFU till the early hours of the morning on Saturday. Prizes will be given out in the middle of the night for the points you earned during the week, so make sure to stay in order to guarantee yourself something nice.</p>
