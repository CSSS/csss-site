<h2 id= "booths" style="text-align: center;">
 <b>Booths</b>
</h2>
This is the core part of Tech Fair, it is where you as a company can come in and set up a booth and advertise to students. Bring some slides, a project demo, some merch, company banner and whatever else you want! You'll be set up with a table, chairs and power outlets.  

This is where you get to highlight why students should be  joining your company. Students will be coming throughout the days you are in attendance to learn about you and your company.

<h2 id="interview_workshop" style="text-align: center;">
 <b>Interview Workshop</b>

We are looking for volunteers who regularly participate in technical interviews to give a technical interview in front of a group of students. Questions asked to these students would be similar to ones they might see in a technical interview, with programming and problem solving problems.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">
 <b>Interview Tips and Tricks</b>

 <b>Resume Workshop</b>
</h2>
We are looking for  volunteers who regularly review resumes to review selected resumes in front of a group of students. The resumes would be ranging from first time co-op seeker to full-time. Students would learn from the constructive comments made and apply those changes to their own resumes.

<br><br>

<h2 id="career_talks" style="text-align: center;">
 <b>Career Talks</b>
</h2>
We are looking for Computing Science or Computer Science graduates who have worked in a variety of companies to come in and speak about their journey. This is an opportunity for students to learn what various careers are like and to answer any questions they may have before beginning their careers.
