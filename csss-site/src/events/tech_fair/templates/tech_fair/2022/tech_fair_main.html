 <b>Booths</b>
</h2>
This is the core part of Tech Fair, it is where you as a company can come in and set up a booth and advertise to students. Bring some slides, a project demo, some merch, company banner and whatever else you want! You'll be set up with a table, chairs and power outlets.  

This is where you get to highlight why students should be  joining your company. Students will be coming throughout the days you are in attendance to learn about you and your company.

 <b>Resume Workshop</b>
