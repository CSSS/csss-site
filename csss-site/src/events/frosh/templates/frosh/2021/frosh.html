                            <p>The Simon Fraser University Computing Science Student Society (CSSS) is a student led society of over 2000 students. If you are declared as a Computer Science Major, Minor, or Honours, you are already part of the society. The CSSS aims to provide the best university life possible for all of the students in the School of Computing Science. Frosh Week is held every year in order to let new students get involved with the community, and help them get adjusted to university life. Throughout the entire year, the CSSS holds events ranging from Board Game Nights, to Hackathons, to Workshops. The <a href = "https://discord.gg/sfucsss">Official CSSS Discord Server</a> is an excellent place to get help with schoolwork, discuss classes, and meet new people. Whether you're just entering SFU, or have been around long enough to remember when the Student Union Building was first promised to us, the CSSS is glad to make your student life all the better.</p>
