<h1>What is FroshWeek?</h1>

<img src="assets/images/tug-o-war.jpg" alt="Tug 'o War" />

<p>FroshWeek is the ultimate introductory experience for Computing Science students at Simon Fraser
University. Organized by the Computing Science Student Society, in partnership with the School of
Computing Science, it is a week of fun-filled activities designed to orient, entertain and educate new
university students with a Computing Science twist.</p>

<p>Held during the first week of the Fall semester at SFU (Sept. 6 - 10), FroshWeek is organized by students, for
students. Incoming students receive: an in-depth introduction to the facilities available to them as
Computing Science students; many entertaining on- and off-campus challenges and diversions to
motivate, amuse, and connect them with other students; valuable advice from their elders with respect 
to courses and the university experience in general; and some free food and tools to make the
transition to university much smoother.</p>

<p>Now in its seventh year, Computing Science's Froshweek has matured into one of the most well
received and recognized student-organized events at Simon Fraser University. It is a memorable and
cherished week for participants and organizers alike.</p>

<h1>What is the Computing Science Student Society?</h1>

<p>The Computing Science Student Society is a departmental student society based out of Simon 
Fraser University. Operating under the Simon Fraser Student Society, we act to recognize the
academic and recreational demands of Computing Science students, providing them with a better
experience at SFU. We have seats on the School of Computing Science Undergraduate Program 
Committee and the Faculty of Applied Science Undergraduate Curriculum Committee. 
The society also facilitates recreational activities, such as
LAN parties, board game nights and movie nights, as well as joining
the Simon Fraser Student Society and other departmental student
societies for events. On a day-to-day level, the society provides
services for Computing Science students such as a common area,
printing, and inexpensive beverages.</p>
